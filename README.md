# OC-P4-Anticipation_des_besoins_en_consommation_electrique_de_batiments (Anticipation of electrical consumption needs of buildings)

## Objectives

* Predict the CO2 emissions and total energy consumption of non-residential buildings for which they have not yet been measured.
* Evaluate the interest of the ENERGY STAR Score for the prediction of CO2 emissions.
